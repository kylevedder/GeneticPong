# GeneticPong
Solving Pong with Genetic Programming!

This is my first attempt at genetic programming in C++.
The goal of this project is to develop the necessary software infrastructure to facilitate genetic programming before
attempting to apply it to a more challenging project domain

## Build Instructions
This project uses [Bazel](http://bazel.io) as the build system. To run the project,
execute `bazel run //src:exec` from the top level folder.
