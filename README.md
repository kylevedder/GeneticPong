# GeneticPong
Solving Pong with Genetic Programming!

This is my first attempt at genetic programming in C++. 
The goal of this project is to develop the necessary software infastructure to facilitate genetic programming before
attempting to apply it to a more challenging project domain

## Build Instructions
This project uses [Bazel](http://bazel.io) as the build system. To run the project,
